# Sudoku-Project

This project is a completed sudoku game that utilizes PyGame. The user has the option to choose a sudoku board that is either easy, medium, or hard difficulty. The game allows the user to navigate the board using their mouse or arrow keys. The user can sketch a value into an empty tile-to enter that value, the user can press the enter key. The delete/backspace key can delete a sketched or entered value. When the board is entirely filled with entered values, the user either wins or loses the game and can choose to restart or exit.
